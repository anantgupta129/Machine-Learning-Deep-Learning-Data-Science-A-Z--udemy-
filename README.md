I would like to thanks instructer Kirill Eremenko and Hadelin de Ponteves, for making this journey so simple

This paper also include some research papers to read.
One can try and imlement each code for practice secondly each code is written as it can be used as a tempelate for other machine Learning projects.
Just change a couple of line and your new model is ready. Its a machine learning toolkit
